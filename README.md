## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Coding challenge:

1. Run the project and open [http://localhost:3000/settings](http://localhost:3000/settings), then go to History tab.
2. Use [Range&nbsp;Date&nbsp;Picker](https://livechat.github.io/design-system/#!/RangeDatePicker) to filter out records in the tabel.
3. Come up with one item that doesn't yet exist in the [LiveChat&nbsp;Design&nbsp;System](https://livechat.github.io/design-system/) and present one use case for it. You can describe it here in the README.

Raise a PR with your solution. Good luck!
